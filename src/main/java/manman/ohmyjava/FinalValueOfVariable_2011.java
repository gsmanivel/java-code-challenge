	/*There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

		++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
		--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
		Initially, the value of X is 0.

		Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

		 

		Example 1:

		Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
		Output: 1
		Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
		Initially, X = 0.
		--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
		X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
		X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.
